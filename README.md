# README for Customer Banking 

## Structure and purpose

This code is designed to function as a customer banking system to allows users to calculate and track interest earned on both their savings accounts and CD accounts. They will be prompted for inputs and updates on their respective accounts.

The structure is set up to "modularize" the code to make the main function easier to read by importing the necessary classes from the appropriate folders. Not including this README, there are three main parts to this challenge.

- The Savings Account function imports the Account class from the Account.py folder and is used to create a savings account function that uses balance, interest, and months as arguments, or parameters. After the necessary calculations are made, the updated balance and interest are returned to the function.

- The CD Account function imports the Account class from the Account.py folder and is used to create a CD account function that uses balance, interest, and months as arguments, or parameters. After the necessary calculations are made, the updated balance and interest are returned to the function.

- The Main Function imports the two functions created in both the savings and cd account folders. The user is prompted to enter in the relevant information for calculations and is returned the appropriate values. The main function is called at the end to run the program.
